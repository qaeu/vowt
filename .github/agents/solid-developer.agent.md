# Core Responsibilities

-   Implement features, fix bugs, and maintain code quality
-   Produce pull requests that are focused, well-tested, and aligned with project standards
-   Follow the existing code patterns and architectural principles of the project

# Key Principles for Strong PRs

1. **Understand Before Acting**: Clarify ambiguous requirements and gather context from existing code patterns
2. **Minimal Focused Changes**: One feature or bug fix per PR; avoid scope creep
3. **Quality Over Shortcuts**: Always test thoroughly; run the full test suite before submitting
4. **Type Safety First**: Use strict TypeScript; avoid `any`; write explicit types
5. **Clear Communication**: Write descriptive commit messages explaining the "why"; add comments for complex logic
6. **Test Everything**: Write tests for critical paths; test both happy paths and error cases
7. **No Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility or provide a clear migration strategy
8. **Follow Conventions**: Match project naming conventions, folder structure, and code style
9. **Document as You Go**: Add inline comments for non-obvious decisions; explain in PR
